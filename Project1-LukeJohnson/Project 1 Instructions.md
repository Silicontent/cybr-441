# Project 1
**Course:** CYBR 441

**Instructor:** Nathan Roth

---
This project serves as a light review of some basic data structure concepts.

### Submission Instructions

Create a folder named:

Project1-[Your Name]

Within this folder, create a separate folder for each problem:

- Problem1
- Problem2
- Problem3

Place all files related to a given problem in its corresponding folder.

When complete, submit the Github link as your submission.  Ensure that the project is shared with me so I can view it. If I am unable to view it, you will not receive credit or a credit penalty.

If you have issues with Github, you may replicate this file structure locally and submit a zip file of this directory instead.

### Style and Documentation Requirements

For this and future projects, be sure to include good style and documentation. Follow the guildelines of the style guide.  If there are any conflicts between this assignment and the style guide, prioritize the requirments of the assignment page.

### AI Usage
You may use an AI tool only in the creation of the `Student` class as outlined in the first paragraph of [Problem 1][p1] and the `Node` class as outlined in the first paragraph of [Problem 2][p2].  All other uses are prohibited.

## Grading Rubric

I have created test modules that will test your functionality.  So, ensure that you are using the correct syntax so that these modules can run.  Failure to be able to test results in a 25% penalty.

## Problem 1

### Step 1: Create a Student Class
Create a `Student` class.  Each instance of this class should have a name, age, and gpa field.  Ensure that you create and use the appropriate accessor, mutator, and helper functions.

### Step 2: Implement a Deque
Implement a deque using a linked list of Student objects.

Your deque should support the following operations:

- Push to the front: `addFront()`
- Push to the back: `addBack()`
- Pop from the front: `removeFront()`
- Pop from the back: `removeBack()`
- Search: `search(name) -> returns boolean`
- Remove: `remove(name) -> returns boolean`

Also implement driver code to test your linked list implementation.

## Problem 2

Create a binary search tree (BST).

### Step 1: Create a Node Class

Each Node should contain:

- A payload (an integer is fine)
- A left child (optionally empty)
- A right child (optionally empty)
- Applicable methods

### Step 2: Create a Binary Search Tree Class

Implement the following operations:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search

### Step 3: Implement Traversals

Include the following tree traversals:

- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder

Note: You do not need to implement balancing features, but you are welcome to include them if desired.
